Hava Ä°srapilova

I am an Urban Planner turned developer who's dedicating all my time and energy to my newfound passion. I am always searching for new ways to learn and improve myself so the constantly changing, evolving nature of the field is what intrigues me. My prior education taught me the fundamentals of forming a team environment and managing fast-paced projects. I am detail-oriented and analytical but also have the need to express myself creatively.
